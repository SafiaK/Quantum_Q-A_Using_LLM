      "question_body": "In physics, its the ability for particles to exist in multiple/parallel dynamic states at a particular point in time. In computing, would it be the ability of a data bit to equal 1 or 0 at the same time, a third value like NULL[unknown] or multiple values?.. How can this technology be applied to: computer processors, programming, security, etc.?.. Has anyone built a practical quantum computer or developed a quantum programming language where, for example, the program code dynamically changes or is autonomous?",

      "answer_body": "I have done research in quantum computing, and here is what I hope is an informed answer. It is often said that qubits as you see them in a quantum computer can exist in a \"superposition\" of 0 and 1. This is true, but in a more subtle way than you might first guess. Even with a classical computer with randomness, a bit can exist in a superposition of 0 and 1, in the sense that it is 0 with some probability and 1 with some probability. Just as when you roll a die and don't look at the outcome, or receive e-mail that you haven't yet read, you can view its state as a superposition of the possibilities. Now, this may sound like just flim-flam, but the fact is that this type of superposition is a kind of parallelism and that algorithms that make use of it can be faster than other algorithms. It is called randomized computation, and instead of superposition you can say that the bit is in a probabilistic state. The difference between that and a qubit is that a qubit can have a fat set of possible superpositions with more properties. The set of probabilistic states of an ordinary bit is a line segment, because all there is a probability of 0 or 1. The set of states of a qubit is a round 3-dimensional ball. Now, probabilistic bit strings are more complicated and more interesting than just individual probabilistic bits, and the same is true of strings of qubits. If you can make qubits like this, then actually some computational tasks wouldn't be any easier than before, just as randomized algorithms don't help with all problems. But some computational problems, for example factoring numbers, have new quantum algorithms that are much faster than any known classical algorithm. It is not a matter of clock speed or Moore's law, because the first useful qubits could be fairly slow and expensive. It is only sort-of parallel computation, just as an algorithm that makes random choices is only in weak sense making all choices in parallel. But it is \"randomized algorithms on steroids\"; that's my favorite summary for outsiders. Now the bad news. In order for a classical bit to be in a superposition, it has be a random choice that is secret from you. Once you look a flipped coin, the coin \"collapses\" to either heads for sure or tails for sure. The difference between that and a qubit is that in order for a qubit to work as one, its state has to be secret from the rest of the physical universe, not just from you. It has to be secret from wisps of air, from nearby atoms, etc. On the other hand, for qubits to be useful for a quantum computer, there has to be a way to manipulate them while keeping their state a secret. Otherwise its quantum randomness or quantum coherence is wrecked. Making qubits at all isn't easy, but it is done routinely. Making qubits that you can manipulate with quantum gates, without revealing what is in them to the physical environment, is incredibly difficult. People don't know how to do that except in very limited toy demonstrations. But if they could do it well enough to make quantum computers, then some hard computational problems would be much easier for these computers. Others wouldn't be easier at all, and great deal is unknown about which ones can be accelerated and by how much. It would definitely have various effects on cryptography; it would break the widely used forms of public-key cryptography. But other kinds of public-key cryptography have been proposed that could be okay. Moreover quantum computing is related to the quantum key distribution technique which looks very safe, and secret-key cryptography would almost certainly still be fairly safe."

      "question_body": "When I am reading chapter 10 of Dasgupta I faced a paragraph that I can't understand: An electron can be in a ground state or in an excited state. In the Dirac notation used in quantum physics, these are denoted 0 and 1. But the superposition principle says that, in fact, the electron is in a state that is a linear combination of these two: a0|0> + a1|1>. This would make immediate sense if the a's were probabilities, nonnegative real numbers adding to 1. But the superposition principle insists that they can be arbitrary complex numbers, as long as the squares of their norms add up to 1! Can someone describe me last 3 lines?",
      "question_tags": "<algorithm><quantum-computing>",
      "answer_body": "I think the author is trying to point out a difference between the quantum model and the standard assumptions you might have about probabilities. Suppose, for example, that the electron is either up or down. In a deterministic universe, it would either be 100% up or 100% down. If we assumed that the electron probabilistically chose to be either up or down with some probabilities, then we might say that, for example, the electron was 50% up and 50% down. When using bra-ket notation for the above, you might be tempted to say that we would say that the particle is 90% up by writing 0.5 |up> + 0.5|down> The intuition being that the electron is simultaneously 50% up and 50% down. However, this would be incorrect. When dealing with quantum states, the configuration of a particle is related to something called the wavefunction, and it is the square of the wavefunction that determines probabilities, not the wavefunction itself. Thus if we wanted to write out a quantum state where a particle has a 50% chance of being up and a 50% chance of being down, we'd represent that as 0.707 |up> + 0.707 |down> Since 0.707 is about the square root of 0.5, so if we square the coefficients assigned to up and down we get back the classical probabilities. As long as the squares of the coefficients sum to one, the coefficients are legal since their square gives back a probability distribution. Of course, it's actually a bit trickier than this. The coefficients in quantum states can be complex numbers as well. For example, this is a perfectly legal quantum configuration: (0.707 + 0.707i) |up> + 0 |down> Here, the coefficient for up is a complex number. To get the probability of seeing up, we compute the complex conjugate of the coefficient: (0.707 + 0.707i)(0.707 - 0.707i) = (0.5 + 0.5) = 1 So in this case the probability of seeing up is 1 and the probability of seeing down is 0^2 = 0. Since this sums to one, this is a valid quantum state. To summarize: a probability distribution is a way of assigning real-valued weights to outcomes so that the weights sum to one. A quantum state is a way of assigning complex-valued weights to outcomes so that the sum of the product of each coefficient with it's complex conjugate is one. Phew! Haven't had to think about that in a while! Hope this helps!"
