20894.0,Saving statevector on more than one location in a quantum circuit in Qiskit,"So, I'm fairly new to Qiskit, and I've been playing around and following the tutorials from the Qiskit textbook. However, there is one thing I fail to understand/implement: for a quantum circuit with multiple gates (e.g. 2-qubit circle, with a simple Hadamard acting on qubit 0 and, let's say, CNOT acting on qubit 1 (controlled by qubit 0)) is it possible somehow to save statevectors more than once, in order to see intermediate state of the system? Below you can see the code idea: q1 = QuantumCircuit(2) q1.save_statevector() # Save initial state q1.h(0) q1.save_statevector() # Save state after Hadamard q1.cx(0, 1) q1.save_statevector() # Save state after CNOT (also a final state) job = execute(q1, backend=Aer.get_backend('aer_simulator'), shots=1024) statevectors = job.result().get_statevector() However, if I were to try and run this, an error occurs upon reaching execute command.

I can verify this is correct empirically using a quantum simulator. I want to measure with respect to new basis states $\ket{+}$ and $\ket{-}$, defined in Quantum Computation and Quantum Information as follows $\ket{+} \equiv \frac{\ket{0}+\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$, $\ket{-} \equiv \frac{\ket{0}-\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$, and corresponding to the poles of the x axis of the Bloch sphere. Looking at the Bloch sphere, I would expect to get $\ket{+}$ half of the time, and $\ket{-}$ the other half, and I have been able to empirically verify this. However, according to the mathematics presented in the aforementioned book, I should be able to express this state $\ket{\psi} = \alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1}$, with the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ previously mentioned, as follows: $$\ket{\psi} = \alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1} = \alpha\frac{\ket{+} + \ket{-}}{\sqrt{2}} + \beta\frac{\ket{+} - \ket{-}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\alpha + \beta}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{+} + \frac{\alpha -\beta}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{-}$$ This math seems sound to me, however if I attempt to translate to this new basis using my $\alpha$ and $\beta$, I get $$ \frac{\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{2-\sqrt{2}}}{2\sqrt{2}}\ket{+} + \frac{\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}} -\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2}}}{2\sqrt{2}}\ket{-} $$ Since $\left(\frac{\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{2-\sqrt{2}}}{2\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \approx 0.85$ this is not at all what I expect from looking at the Bloch sphere, and does not match what I am able to demonstrate empirically.

The procedure goes as follows: (1) The system and meter is initialized by some initial state $\vert\Psi\rangle=\vert\psi_{i}\rangle \otimes \vert \phi\rangle$. The evolution of the system $U = \exp(-igA \otimes B)$ is approximated to $1_{A}\otimes 1_{B}-ig A\otimes B$, since $g$ is extremely small. we get $$U\vert\Psi_{i}\rangle\approx(1_{A}\otimes 1_{B}-ig A\otimes B)\vert\psi_{i}\rangle \otimes \vert \phi\rangle,$$ $$(1_{A}\vert\psi_{i}\rangle\otimes 1_{B}\vert \phi\rangle-ig A\vert\psi_{i}\rangle\otimes B\vert\phi\rangle).$$ (2) After the evolution, the system is post selected onto some final state $\vert\psi_{f}\rangle$ (which is nearly orthogonal to the initial state) $$\langle\psi_{f}\vert U\vert\Psi_{i}\rangle\approx P_{s}(1_{B}\vert\phi\rangle - ig A_{w}B\vert\phi\rangle)$$. Where $P_s = \langle\psi_{f}\vert\psi_{i}\rangle$ is the post-selection probability and $A_{w} = \langle\psi_{f}\vert A\vert\psi_{i}\rangle/P_{s}$ is called the weak value. (3) If i re-exponentiate the above term, we get $$\frac{\langle\psi_{f}\vert U\vert\Psi_{i}\rangle}{P_{s}}=\exp(-igA_{w}B)\vert\phi\rangle$$ where the exponential on the RHS is the Kraus operator acting on the meter intial state, using which one can estimate the small parameter $g$.

Grover's algorithm requires a way to flip the phase of the starting superposition. Normally, the way to do this is to apply $H$ gates to every qubit and flip the all-zeros state, then apply $H$ again to return to the previous state, but after solving the first clause, the superposition $\vert\psi_1\rangle$ is not just $H^{\otimes n}\vert 0^n\rangle$. In fact, (as far as I am aware) the only way to construct a diffusion operator for the superposition $\vert\psi_1\rangle$ where $C_1$ is solved is to undo the solution for $C_1$, then apply $H$ gates, then flip over $\vert 0^n\rangle$, then redo those same operations. If you do that, then you can run Grover's algorithm on a clause-by-clause basis and solve the 3-SAT problem. However, the cost is not polynomial: If there are $m$ clauses, for the last clause, the diffusion operator must solve and unsolve an $m-1$ clause 3-SAT problem. So if the cost of solving this problem is $c_{m-1}$, the total cost will be $\approx\sqrt{2^3}c_{m-1}$. But solving an $m-1$ clause 3-SAT problem will require a diffusion operator that solves an $m-2$ clause 3-SAT problem, so $c_{m-1}\approx \sqrt{2^3}c_{m-2}$ (and so on). You end up multiplying all of the factors of $\sqrt{2^3}$ each time you go through, and the total cost ends up as something like $O(\sqrt{2^{3m}})$ -- which is roughly the exponential cost you would expect from a naive Grover search.",05/05/2021 08:14,,,False,False,Request timeout after 120 seconds,Request timeout after 120 seconds,{},{},2025-09-23T19:31:22.420110
